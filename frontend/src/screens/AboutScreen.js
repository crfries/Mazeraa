        <h1>about</h1>
        Our brand is Mazeraa. It’s not a name. It’s not a word. But Mazeraa has
        weight. Its unique meaning comes from the community we’ve built and
        continue to build—a community united by style. It’s defined by me and
        you. It’s one man’s hustle, one woman’s ambition, someone’s swagger,
        another’s confidence.
        <br />
        <br />
        Mazeraa’s logo is a crown because we believe in making everyone feel
        like a King or Queen. Our mission is to enable everyone to tap into the
        fairy tale version of royalty because fashion is about so much more than
        the fabric on our bodies and Mazeraa has the power to transform.
        <br />

        Launched in January 2020 in what was to be a moment of excitement and
        promise, the brand was forced to pause along with many others as the
        world found itself in the midst of a deadly pandemic. Suddenly
        connection and inclusivity—the core of Mazeraa—were more important than
        ever. And so we persevered.

        The small, Black-owned brand was founded and is operated by a former
        athlete with a passion for fashion. His interest in luxury has always
        been about personality, originality and craftmanship rather than a
        worshipped brand name. As he embarked on a design and sourcing journey
        to enrich his own wardrobe, he realized everyone seemed to want a piece
        of it. He was getting positive feedback, compliments and requests every
        time he stepped out or showcased these new, feel-good styles. A business
        was born. Soon, luxe-looking fashions for others with busy, active lives
        were being created exclusively for Mazeraa.com. Thanks to his sports
        background, he ensures comfort, quality and versatility are a key part
        of the brand’s designs which include shirts, hoodies, pants and more in
        rich, cozy fabrics like panne velour.

        Mazeraa currently carries fashion streetwear and loungewear for men and
        women with plans to expand into accessories and clothing for kids.
